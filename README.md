# SinDy V.4

This bot is being built, assembled, and worked on. In its current state it is a repackaging of Jaanus' Voicebot, with my own [api.ai](https://api.ai) backend and some style changes. 

This is a simple web-based voicebot built against [api.ai](https://api.ai) backend. It implements a static client app, as well as a simple web service for doing math.

## Demo

This is running at [nullality.github.io](https://nullality.github.io)

## But why?

Many people, myself included, suffer from different Stress Disorders. This came from a real world need to not involve my partner with my attacks while building techniques to manage and better myself. I hope to apply natural language into a fully packaged form with varying range of portability and form solidarity. While it may not work 'out-the-box' entirely for everyone, my goal is to help achieve an assistive AI that can help others in [but not limited to] grounding, disengaging, coping, identifying triggers and even building better habits. I'm not sure where this project will take me, but i'll say my plan is to take it a lot further than just an app.
