# SinDy V.4

This bot is being developed. In its current state it is a cute repackaging of Jaanus' Voicebot. I.e. My own [api.ai](https://api.ai) backend and some style changes. I do hope to add quite a bit of code = )

This is a web-based voicebot built with [api.ai](https://api.ai) backend. It implements a static client app, tries to communicate, and can run as a simple web service for doing math.

## Demo

This is running at [nullality.github.io](https://nullality.github.io)

## But why?

Many people, myself included, suffer from different Stress Disorders. This came from a real world need. I hope to apply natural language coding, and multiple technologies into a fully packaged form with varying range of portability and form solidarity. While it may not work 'out-the-box' entirely for everyone, or anyone for a while, my goal is to help achieve an assistive AI that can help others in [but not limited to] grounding, disengaging, coping, identifying triggers and even building better habits. I'm not sure where this project will take me, but I'll say my plan is to take it a lot further than just an app.
