# SinDy V.4 

This bot is being developed. In its current state it is a cute repackaging of Jaanus' Voicebot. I.e. My own [api.ai](https://api.ai) backend and some style changes. I do hope to add quite a bit of code = )

This is a web-based voicebot built with [api.ai](https://api.ai) backend. It implements a static client app, tries to communicate, and can run as a simple web service for doing math.

## Demo

This is running at [nullality.github.io](https://nullality.github.io)

## But why?

Many people, myself included, suffer from different Stress Disorders that range from PTSD to General Anxiety. This project came from a real world need. I hope to apply natural language coding, and multiple technologies into a fully packaged form with varying range of portability and form solidarity. While it may not work 'out-the-box' entirely for everyone, or anyone for a while, my goal is to help achieve an assistive AI that can help others in [but not limited to] grounding, disengaging, coping, identifying triggers and even building better habits. I'm not sure where this project will take me, but I'll say my plan is to take it a lot further than just an app.

 ### What's been done
 - Design temporary logo
 - Add some styles
 - Redeisgn bot svg
 - Change interval of speech / listening (needs fine tuning)
 - Created this
 - Purchased, received, set up Raspberry Pi
 - Wrote ~15 pages of dialogue that needs to be transcribed into API.AI / Dialogflow
 - Researching. Researching. Researching.
 
 #### Hmmm
 - Maybe do Python Library too?
 - Use AIML at all?
 
### Raspberry Pi
- Purchased and received Raspberry Pi zero w.
- Made a custom enclosure.
- Got linux working, soldered GPIO pins, getting sound through pHat intermittently. 
> Might be a short in the speaker. I need to salvage a small speaker from goodwill.
